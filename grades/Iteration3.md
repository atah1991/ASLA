# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 15

**Evaluator: [Flynn, Michael](mailto:mflynn@jhu.edu)**


## Positive Points:

* It's a complicated project, but I feel like you all are on top of everything!
* Good use of GitHub issues / projects.


## Things to Improve:

### No automated build?

Keep in mind that you should have at least a script to automate the build of
your project. Also, you're going to want to distribute your frontend to your
users, right? How do you create the executable that's ultimately going to be
run by the user? I doubt you're going to want to have users run your app
through PyCharm.

*(-8 points)*

## Show ML Metrics

In the next iterations, I want to see some numbers about how well the machine
algorithms perform and what kind of engineering tradeoffs you're making.

**This is going to be a special requirement for you all starting next
iteration.**


## Overall:

So far so good, but think about how you're going to package and deploy your
project as well.

** Grade: 92/100 **
