#### Group Number: 15 ASL-a

#### Presentation

Excellent, but it went too long.

##### App demo comments.  Did any errors/glitches arise during the demo?

  - Taking in account different dialects and other hard problems.

  - Limited scope, proof-of-concept.

  - Hard problems with concurrency had to be solved in the front-end due to Qt issues.

  - For now, signing up is useless. It is for extended features that werenâ€™t
    implemented.

  - Two desktop applications. One for /experts/ to train, one for /users/.

  - /Expert/ training data is pushed to the server and then pulled by /users/
    applications.

  - Good object-oriented design: template design pattern.

  - Great documentation.

  - OpenGL required integration to show the hand.

#### Iteration 6

##### Code inspection

- ++

##### Architecture - was the code cleanly structured in terms of packages, deployment, etc

- ++

##### Tests - good coverage?  Travis working?

- ++

##### Final code documentation

- ++

##### GitHub usage

- I'm sure you all were in a rush to get this finished, but avoid having
  everyone write to master.

##### Machine Learning Stats

- Much better this time around, results are more interpretable and realistic.
- Analysis for all of your hyperparameter tuning is helpful and good to keep
  around as well. (I hope none of that took *too* long, that looks like a lot
  of parameters!)

#### Project difficulty in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion

 - This was a very challenging project in terms of machine learning as well as architecture.

 - Many very nice aspects of architecture, e.g. automatic download of latest model, calibrating, etc.

#### Overall remarks

You should have commented on http://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2015/PDP7080.pdf which has some similar results using a decision tree model.

This was a very ambitious project which while not getting as far as planned still got the core set up and working and serves as a proof of concept that such a real system could be built.
