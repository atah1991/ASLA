OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group: 15**

### Attendance: anyone missing?

* All good!

### Overview of project: clearly explained and understandable?

* Great introduction and motivation.
* Not super clear that this is a native/desktop application.

### Demo: clear?

* Very neat demo.
  * Can you do letters yet?
* Also good that you showed the website too.

### Architecture explained? General structure of code at this point explained?

* Good overview of architecture, very unique technologies.

### Presentation organization, both in terms of logistics and quality of slides, properly taking turns, demo going smoothly, etc.

* Overall very well organized, thorough.

### Project comments we noticed during presentation:

* It seems weird that experts can only submit data if the accuracy goes up.
  What if your data is biased and you have someone training against that bias?
* Why are your two servers completely decoupled? Shouldn't they at a minimum be
  able to share a common user model?
