# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 15

**Evaluator: [Flynn, Michael](mailto:mflynn@jhu.edu)**


## Positive Points:

* Big improvement over the last iteration, very detailed and very clear.
* Architecture is much more detailed, I have a very good idea of how you're
  going to go about this.
* Use cases and UI sketches are great as well.


## Things to Improve:

### UML Diagram

It's very unclear where the separation is between your back end and your client
is, and it seems to be mixing concepts from the two together. Since your front
end is complex enough, it may be worthwhile providing separate class diagrams
for your client and your web server. But otherwise, it doesn't make sense to
combine them because they don't inherit from one another.

*(-2 points)*


## Suggestions:

### Make sure you're doing proper engineering for machine learning

Same comment from last iteration -- I do not see any detail about algorithms,
accuracy, latency, etc. This is all very important to know, since it's core to
your application and is a real engineering consideration here.

*This may become an extra requirement for this project in future iterations, if
we don't see real evidence that this is really going to work soon.*

### Maybe focus on one of your extended features as a goal

Your extended features are interesting and are (at least what I think) what
will make this project really useful outside of this course. It might be a good
idea to pick one and say "yes, this is what we're going for." Right now I don't
see you being able to implement all of them for the class, but it might help
direct development if you choose one.


## Overall:

Great work, I'm very interested to see how this develops.

** Grade: 98/100 **


## Iteration 1 Update:

* Use cases are correct (+7.5)
* Back end is clarified (although your UML stil has problems) (+1)
* Use cases and UI for "Expert" role (+2)
* Architecture is more detailed (+2)
* Is this going to work? You still need to convince me :)

** Reclaimed: 12.5 points **
